Project Title: CampusConnect - The Next-Gen Student Grievance Portal

The Problem: In most universities, reporting a simple issue (like broken Wi-Fi or a mistake in grades) is a nightmare. Students have to run between departments, fill out physical forms, and wait weeks without knowing the status of their complaint. The process is opaque, slow, and frustrating.

The Solution: CampusConnect is a centralized, digital support desk that bridges the gap between students and administration. It replaces manual paperwork with a sleek, 3D-interactive web portal.

Key Features:

Instant Ticket Creation: Students can raise issues in seconds with a "No-Login" fast interface.

Live Status Tracking: Students can track their issue (Pending -> Solved/Rejected) in real-time using their Register Number.

Secure Admin Dashboard: A protected area for faculty (Hardcoded: XCODERS / 0123) to view all complaints, write responses, and close tickets.

Modern UI/UX: Built with Glassmorphism and 3D parallax effects to engage the modern student demographic.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Backend: Node.js, Express

API: REST API

Design: Custom CSS with Glassmorphism
